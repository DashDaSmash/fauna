# fauna

This app is for learning about animals. There's a catalog of animals.
Once clicked, it opens description page. There is only one description page while content is fully dynamic.
On description page, app searches the keyword on wikipedia, fetch the JSON file and show the description in the app.
This procedure not only saves storage space required but also makes it more interractive.
